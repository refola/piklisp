# simple_function.pik
# Simple function test for Piklisp.

# All this does is define and run a simple function, something
# essential to any programming language. Note that the Piklisp
# function skips the parentheses of the Python function, and also
# lacks the return keyword.

def square number :
	** number 2

# Note that parentheses are required for the inner function call,
# since otherwise print would print the function and 3 instead of the
# result of calling the function with 3.

print (square 3)
