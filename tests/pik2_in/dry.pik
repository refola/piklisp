### Utility functions

## Here are some functions for evaluating stuff and showing the expression being evaluated. After conversion to Piklisp it works like a Lisp macro so it should work regardless of where it's defined relative to the variable scope it's used in.
# Throw away any return value(s).
= null fn * _ :
	None
# Show and EVAL a string. Yay macros!
= seval macro * x :
	` print (% "%20s == %r" ',@x ,@x)
# Run seval on everything. Yay list comprehensions!
= sevals macro * things :
	` null (do-for-in (seval thing) thing things)

# Pause until the user presses enter, allowing the program to do the following action.
= pause fn action = "continue" :
	input (% "Press [Enter] to %s. " action)


### Get arguments of the correct type, prompting the user as necessary.

# Attempt conversion of value to Type.
= try-convert fn value Type :
	try
		Type value
		except ValueError
		None

# Get input by type, looping until satisfied.
= get-by-type fn name Type :
	= ret None
	while is ret None
		= ret try-convert (input (% "Please enter %s. " name)) Type
		if is ret None :
			print (% "Error. I was expecting input of type %s." Type)
	ret

# Get arguments interactively if full args list not given. Descriptions are 2-tuples containing the text to show the user and the type of thing you want. Use get-by-type to get a single argument.
= get-args fn given * descriptions:
	= ret []
	# First try seeing if the arguments work.
	if == (len given) (len descriptions) :
		= types map ((fn x : x 1) descriptions)
		= val-type-pairs zip given types
		= ret tuple (do-for-in (try-convert * x) x val-type-pairs)
		if not in None ret : # If all conversions successful
			return ret # An explicit return is required because it's not the end of the function.
	# If not, get fresh input.
	return (do-for-in (get-by-type * desc) desc descriptions)


### Run functions with a minimal menu list.

# Tell the user what functions are available.
= defaultusage fn keys :
	print (% "Usage: python3 %s [fn] [args]" (sys.argv 0))
	print "Runs function fn, optionally with given arguments."
	print (% "Functions are as follows: %s" keys)

# Call the appropriate function, prompting the user if one isn't specified.
= runThings fn fmap *_ args = (sys.argv 1 ::) fnPrompt = "function name" running = (fn name : % "Running function %s." name) usage = defaultusage :
	# Report if the given function could be ran.
	= try-run fn f args :
		if in f fmap :
			print (running f)
			(fmap fn) @args
			True
		else:
			print (% "Invalid %s: '%s'." fnPrompt fn)
			False
	# Keys for usage function's reference
	= keys list fmap.keys
	keys.sort
	# Until function invoked, prompt for function name
	while or (< (len args 1)) (not try-run (args 0) (args 1 ::)) :
		usage keys
		= args [] (get-by-type fnPrompt str)
