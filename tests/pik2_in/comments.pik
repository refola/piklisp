# Test comment parsing and docstring preservation of Piklisp.

# Piklisp should leave only docstring comments. These consist of
# triple-double-quoted strings, but that might change to just regular
# double-quoted strings.

"""This is a single-line triple-double-quote comment."""

"""This is a
multi-line
triple-double-quote
comment,
with the quotes on the same lines as the text."""

"""
This is a multi-line
triple-double-quote

on different lines than
the text.

"""This is a triple-double-quote
