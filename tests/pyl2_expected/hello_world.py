# hello_world.py[l]
# Python3 or Pyylisp hello world program.

# Note that the Pyylisp is identical to how it would be done in
# Python2, before they decided that print shouldn't be special. I
# agree that print shouldn't be special, which is why you can do this
# for all functions in Pyylisp.

print("Hello world")
